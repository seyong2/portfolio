I was born and raised in South Korea, and at the age of 18, I made the bold decision to move to Spain on my own to pursue my studies. This experience shaped me in ways I never anticipated, teaching me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of stepping out of my comfort zone to embrace new opportunities. That sense of adventure has since taken me to live in different cities around the world, giving me the chance to create priceless memories and experiences along the way. 

I'm currently based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, where I am seeking new opportunities to work as a Data Scientist. My passion lies in using data to solve complex business problems and make a meaningful impact.
