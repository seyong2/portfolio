I decided to dedicate myself to this project—creating a mobile application that helps cat owners understand how their cat is feeling. Long story short, my husband had the opportunity to pursue a PhD in Amsterdam, and since we had always wanted to live there, we quit our jobs and moved to the Netherlands to start a new chapter in our lives.

As a foreigner, it took me some time to get a work permit, and naturally, I got bored. Wondering how to keep myself entertained in the meantime, I thought, *"Why not work on a cool data science project that could also be a plus when job hunting?"* I could have joined a Kaggle competition, but I wanted to try something different—something that truly interested me.

Since I love cats, I figured, *"Why not do something cat-related? That way, I get to spend all day looking at cat photos!"* And that's how it all started. I came across a fascinating dataset of cat faces with facial landmarks and thought it would be the perfect foundation for a project—developing an algorithm that detects facial landmarks on a cat’s face and determines how the cat is feeling.

Here, I'll take you along on my journey—from collecting data to building and deploying the algorithm. If you're interested, stay tuned!
