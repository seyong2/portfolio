It's been almost three months since my husband and I moved to Amsterdam. He had the opportunity to pursue a Master's degree here, so we decided to embark on a new adventure. I applied for a work permit, which took about two months to process and then began my job search. I knew finding a job wouldn't be easy, especially with limited work experience, but I didn't anticipate it being this challenging. Despite sending my resume to various positions on LinkedIn, I haven’t received many positive responses.

During my job search, I enjoyed watching Jeremy Howard's Practical Deep Learning for Coders. Initially, I thought the material might be too basic since I had already covered most of the concepts during my Master's degree. However, I ended up learning a lot about efficiently coding for complex data problems. The course also taught me how to deploy algorithms so that others can use them.

With the job hunt not going as expected, I've been watching cat videos to lift my spirits. I love cats, even though I don’t have one of my own. Then, I had a thought: "What if I create an app that recognizes the emotions of cats?" It felt like the perfect way to combine my passion for cats with an opportunity to hone my data science skills. That's how this idea was born.

Here, I'll take you along on my journey—from collecting data to building and deploying the algorithm. If you're interested, stay tuned!
