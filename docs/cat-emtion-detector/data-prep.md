In the last post, we explored various emotions cats can have and grouped them into six different states: Relaxed / Content, Fearful / Defensive, Aggressive / Irritated, Curious / Alert, Affectionate, and Indifferent / Bored states based on the physical cues that the cats express in each state. The next step is to collect images for each state as inputs to an algorithm for recognizing cats' feelings. Thus, I downloaded 300 different cat images, 50 images for each state, that indicate their emotions.
