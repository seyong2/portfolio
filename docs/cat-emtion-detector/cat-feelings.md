The first step in creating a product capable of recognizing cats' emotions is to identify the various feelings that cats can experience. Initially, I thought that cats might express as many emotions as we humans do. However, after reading multiple articles, I realized that understanding feline emotions is more complex than I had anticipated.

According to the articles, less research has been conducted on cats compared to dogs, but it is believed that cats can experience emotions such as fear, anxiety, anger, happiness, relief, frustration, and even depression. Unlike dogs, though, cats are less likely to outwardly display their emotions. So, does that mean that we can't tell how a cat feels? Not exactly. While it's more subtle, cats do use different forms of communication—such as vocalizations and body language—to express their emotions.

Feline emotions can be grouped into four broad groups: positive emotions, negative emotions, neural states, and curiosity/alertness. Let's take a closer look at the body language, facial expressions, and postures associated with each group.

### Positive Emotions

- Happiness / Contentment
  - Body posture: A relaxed and loose body is a clear sign of a happy cat. The cat may be lying on its side or belly with paws stretched out, indicating comfort and security.
  - Tail: A high, gently waving tail is a classic sign of contentment or friendliness.
  - Ears: Upright and slightly forward ears show that the cat is calm and happy.
  - Eyes: A soft, relaxed face with half-closed eyes (or slow blinking) is a common sign of a happy, relaxed cat. The pupils are typically narrowed or slit-like.
    
- Affection
  - Body posture: Cats may rub against objects or people, nudge with their head (headbutt), or knead with their paws. Rolling over and exposing their belly can also indicate a desire for attention.
  - Tail: An upright tail with a slight curl at the tip is often a sign of affection. A cat may also wrap its tail around a person or another animal.
  - Ears: Forward-facing, relaxed ears show that the cat is feeling positive.
  - Eyes: Soft, relaxed eyes with slow blinks show affection and trust.
  
- Playfulness
  - Body posture: A playful cat might crouch in a ready-to-pounce position or lie on its side while swatting at toys or other objects. Bouncing or darting movements are common.
  - Tail: an erect tail with a slight twitch or flick can indicate excitement and playfulness.
  - Ears: Forward-facing ears show that the cat is focused and ready for action.
  - Eyes: Wide, alert eyes with slightly dilated pupils are common during play. The mouth remains closed, but whiskers may be pushed forward in excitement.
    
However, note that pupil size can also be affected by lighting conditions. In bright environments, even an angry or aggressive cat can have constricted pupils. A cat's pupils naturally constrict to control the amount of light entering their eyes, regardless of mood.

### Negative Emotions

- Fear
  - Body posture: A fearful cat will have a crouched body, trying to make itself smaller or get low to the ground. The cat might also arch its back if trying to appear more threatening.
  - Tail: A tucked tail close to the body or between legs signals fear.
  - Ears: Flatted ears, pressed back against the head, are a strong indicator of fear.
  - Eyes: Wide, dilated pupils and a tense face indicate fear. The whiskers may also be pulled back.
    
- Anger
  - Body posture: An aggressive cat will often have a rigid stance. It might puff up its fur to appear larger and more intimidating.
  - Tail: A twitching or thumping tail is a sign of irritation or aggression. A bristled tail (fur standing up) also indicates an angry of defensive stance.
  - Ears: Flatted ears turned sideways or backward suggest aggression or irritation.
  - Eyes: A cat showing its teeth with a wrinkled nose, dilated pupils, and a tense mouth is often preparing to strike or defend itself. Hissing or growling may accompany this posture.
    
- Stress / Anxiety
  - Body posture: Cats experiencing stress may crouch low to the ground, or hide in tight spaces. They might also shift their weight between their paws or move restlessly.
  - Tail: A low, twitching tail or a tail wrapped around the body can indicate anxiety.
  - Ears: Ears that are partially turned back or flattened can be a sign of stress.
  - Eyes: Wide, dilated pupils and tense facial muscles indicate stress. The whiskers may be rigid and pushed outward.

### Neutral / Passive States

- Relaxation
  - Body posture: A fully stretched-out body or curled up in a comfortable position indicates a relaxed state. Cats lying on their backs with their bellies exposed are often showing trust.
  - Tail: The tail might be still, gently curled, or loosely draped, showing that the cat feels safe.
  - Ears: Ears in a neutral, upright position suggest relaxation.
  - Eyes: Closed or half-closed eyes, relaxed whiskers, and slowing blinking indicate a calm, relaxed cat.
    
- Boredom
  - Body posture: A bored cat may lay around lazily, often sprawled or resting with its head on the floor or a surface. It may also shift between positions or move sluggishly.
  - Tail: Slow, rhythmic tail flicking or not movement at all suggest boredom.
  - Ears: Relaxed or slightly tilted ears show indifference.
  - Eyes: The cat's eyes might be half-closed or fully open but unfocused. A bored cat often looks relaxed but disinterested in its surroundings.

### Curiosity / Alertness

  - Curiosity / Interest
    - Body posture: Cats that are curios or alert will have a forward-leaning posture, often standing or sitting upright, ready to investigate their environment.
    - Tail: The tail might be held up or slightly twitching, indicating focus or excitement.
    - Ears: Forward-facing ears show that the cat is paying attention to something interesting.
    - Eyes: Wide, focused, dilated eyes and forward-pointing whiskers suggest curiosity. The mouth is usually closed, with the head slightly tilted.

Now that we've explored how cats express different emotions through their body language, we can group these emotions into six states based on similar physical cues.

### Relaxed / Content States:
- Body posture: Loose, stretched out, or curled comfortably.
- Tail: Still or gently waving.
- Ears: Upright or slightly forward.
= Facial expression: Soft, relaxed eyes, slow blinking, relaxed whiskers.
- Feelings:
  - Happiness / Contentment
  - Relaxation

### Fearful / Defensive States:
- Body posture: Crouched, low to the ground, or arched back (in defensive mode).
- Tail: Tucked close to the body or puffed up.
- Ears: Flattened against the head.
- Facial expression: Wide eyes with dilated pupils, tense face, whiskers pulled back.
- Feelings:
  - Fear
  - Stress / Anxiety

### Aggressive / Irritated States:
- Body posture: Rigid, tense, or puffed-up body.
- Tail: Twitching or bristled.
- Ears: Flattened backward or sideways.
- Facial expression: Tense face, exposed teeth, dilated pupils, possibly growling or hissing.
- Feelings:
  - Anger / Aggression

### Curious / Alert States:
- Body posture: Upright, forward-leaning, or standing on paws.
- Tail: Raised, slightly twitching or upright.
- Ears: Forward-facing.
- Facial expression: Wide, focused eyes, forward-facing whiskers.
- Feelings:
  - Curiosity / Interest
  - Playfulness

### Affectionate States:
- Body posture: Rubbing against objects or people, headbutting, or rolling onto back.
- Tail: Upright, sometimes wrapped around a person or another animal.
- Ears: Forward-facing, relaxed.
- Facial expression: Relaxed, slow blinking, soft whiskers.
- Feelings:
  - Affection

### Indifferent / Bored States:
- Body posture: Sprawled or lazy, moving slowly, resting the head on a surface.
- Tail: Slow flicking or no movement.
- Ears: Neutral, slightly tilted or relaxed.
- Facial expression: Half-closed eyes, indifferent expression.
- Feelings:
  - Boredom

I will use this classification to gather images representing each of these states for the algorithm.
