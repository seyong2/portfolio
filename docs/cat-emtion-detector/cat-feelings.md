The first step in developing a product that can recognize cats' emotions is to identify the range of feelings that cats experience. Initially, I thought this would be a simple task, but as I explored various online sources, I realized that there was no consensus on the types of emotions that could be detected in cats. After further research, I came across a study by Nicholson, S.L. and O’Carroll, R.Á., where they defined five primary emotions for domestic cats and developed a feline emotions ethogram. This tool is intended to help veterinary professionals better understand feline behavior, ultimately improving overall feline welfare.

The authors emphasized emotions as key indicators of cats' welfare, highlighting that, like humans, animals also experience emotions. Since behavior is closely influenced by emotional states, understanding feline behavior is essential for veterinary professionals to accurately assess a cat's emotions. The researchers identified and defined five core, recognizable emotions in animals: fear, anger/rage, joy/play, contentment, and interest. The definitions of each emotion are as follows:


| Emotion  | Definition |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| *Fear* | Negative emotional state caused by immediate perceived danger or the threat of danger and manifested as vigilance and attempts to withdraw or escape.  |
| *Anger/Rage* | Negative emotional state caused by the frustrated desire to perform actions/achieve goals (including escape or exploration) or by competition for resources. Manifested as aggression or the threat of aggression.  |
| *Joy/Play* | A high-intensity positive emotional state, which may be internally motivated. Manifested as non-functional behaviors involving physical activity (locomotor play), interaction with other individuals (social play), or interaction with objects (object play). |
| *Contentment* | A positive emotional state caused by the fulfilment of the animal’s needs and desires and an acceptance of their current state. Manifested as resting, calm, and affiliative behavior.  |
| *Interest* | A positive emotional state, caused by the presence of a novel stimulus or stimulus of salience and/or anticipation of engagement. Manifested as attention and orientation to the stimulus and/or seeking behaviors. |

Building on these definitions, the researchers identified behaviors, postures, and body language associated with each emotion. They also considered the risk of handler injury and welfare issues, providing a comprehensive guide. To support the ethogram, they included multiple photographs of cats exhibiting behaviors that corresponded to each emotional state. The feline emotions ethogram and accompanying images were then reviewed by two certified clinical animal behaviorists for validation. Although the authors acknowledged that the guide requires further field testing for reliability, I believe it provides a strong foundation for my project.

Now, let's explore the completed feline emotions guide and the images associated with each emotional state.

| Emotion  | Body Language | | | | Actions | Risk of handler injury | Risk of welfare issue | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Eyes | Ears | Tail | Body | | | |
| *Fear* | Wide open eyes with round dilated pupils. Blinking or half blinking. Or eyes tightly shut or avoidance of eye contact. Gaze to left in mild fear states. | Flattened to the side or back. Ear pinnae are not visible. | Tucked under the body or wrapped around it. | Piloerection. Tense muscles. Crouching. Lowered head. Standing with an arched back. Left head turn in mild fear. | Vigilance. Startle. Trembling. Freezing. Hiding. Fleeing/avoidance. Grooming. No maintenance behaviors (eating, drinking, elimination)/sleep. | Moderate | High |
| *Anger/Rage* | Pupilos oblong and dilated. Direct stare. | Swivelled sideways. Inner pinnae are visible. | Lowered and rigid. Held in an inverted L shape. Slapping against the ground. Rapidly moved from side to side (or up and down) (Tail lash). | Exposing teeth. Launching at/chasing individuals. Attacking with paws or mouth. Displace others. | High | High |
| *Joy/Play* | Pupils dilated/round due to arousal. Or relaxed/soft. | Upright and forward facing | Vertical. May take an inverted U shape. | "Play face" in kittens: a half-open mouth. Arching spine. Body posture varies. | Locomotor play. Climbing. Running. Social play. Approaching cat. Jumping. Patting, pawing playmate. Grabbing playmate with forelimbs. Biting playmate. Rolling/presenting belly. Wrestling playmate. Kicking/raking playmate. Chasing playmate. Side stepping or running away from playmate. Object play. Rearing to reach object. Pawing, batting object. Holding object with paws. Sniffing, licking object. Biting, chewing object. Throwing object. Wrestling with object. Predatory: Stalking, chasing, jumping, pouncing on object. | Moderate | Moderate |
| *Contentment* | Pupils are small miotic vertical ovals. Half-open. | Upright and forward facing. | Tail relaxed and still. May be erect and slightly curled. | Sitting. Lying curled up in circular formation. | Stretching. Yawning. Grooming self or other (allogrooming). Kneading/treading paws. Friendly greeting (nose touching/sniffing, head butting, rubbing face and body against object/individual-allorubbing). Rolling onto back or from side to side. Nuzzling. Eating. Clawing object. | Low | Low |
| *Interest* | Dilated/round pupils. Gaze to right. Observing an individual or object. | Upright and directed forward towards stimulus. Ear flick. | Depends on context. Horizontal. Tail up/vertical in friendly greeting. | Standing on hindlimbs. Resting forepaws against object. Stretching head out forward. Head turn to right. | Exploring the area or objects. Sniffing. Licking. Pawing. Friendly greeting (touching noses with another cat or rubbing face & body against object/individual-allorubbing). Hunting (stalking, chasing, pouncing, grabbing, biting). | Moderate | Moderate |

*Please note that pupil size and shape may also be influenced by arousal and ambient light levels.

I will use this ethogram to collect cat image data. While the guide outlines four key aspects of body language and actions for each emotional state, I plan to focus on eye and ear signals to determine if these two indicators alone are sufficient for recognizing cat emotions.
