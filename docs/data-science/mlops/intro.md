As part of building my application to identify cats' emotions, I realized that deploying the model is just as important as training it. That's where machine learning operations (MLOps) comes in. MLOps covers the entire lifecycle of a machine learning projectâ€”from defining data and training models to deployment and monitoring. In this section, I'll be sharing key MLOps concepts that I'm learning, which are essential for deploying models effectively. If you're working on your own algorithms, these insights might help you too. Stay tuned!
