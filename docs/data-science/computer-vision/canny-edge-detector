Edge detection is a fundamental technique in computer vision, used to identify edges—defined as curves in a digital image where brightness changes sharply or, more formally, where discontinuities occur. Among various methods, the Canny edge detector, developed by John F. Canny in 1986, remains a state-of-the-art operator. It uses a multi-stage algorithm to robustly detect a wide range of edges in images.

In this notebook, we will explore how the Canny edge detection algorithm works using an example image of a cat. Let’s begin by importing the necessary Python libraries and loading the sample image.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

```python
# Load the image
img = Image.open('/Users/syryoo/Downloads/thor2.jpg')
```

```python
# Display the image
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

The Canny edge detection algorithm consists of five main steps:

Apply a Gaussian filter to smooth the image and reduce noise.
Compute the intensity gradients of the image.
Perform non-maximum suppression to eliminate spurious responses to edge detection.
Apply double thresholding to identify potential edges.
Use edge tracking by hysteresis to finalize the edge map, retaining only strong edges and those connected to them.
Before beginning this process, the image must be converted to grayscale. This simplifies the computation by reducing the image to a single intensity channel, while preserving essential structural information. To perform the conversion, we use the standard luminance formula:

$$L=0.299R+0.587G+0.114 B$$

These coefficients reflect human visual perception—our eyes perceive green as brighter than red, and red as brighter than blue.
